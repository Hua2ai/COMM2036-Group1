                <h3>Choosing your direction</h3>
                <p>There are two kinds of situations. If your motivation of being an uploader is your interest, you may stick on your mind and do what you like. If you want to earn your living by making vedieos, you need to know what your fans would like to watch and by doing what can bring you more porfit.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>For interest: For the uploaders who treat making vedieos as an interest, you don't need to follow the trend. You can always focus on what you are interested.<br>What you need to do is to improve your skills of making vedieos, making them more fascinating and keep learning to make sure your vedios are meaningful.</li>
                    <p> </p>
                    <li>For job: For the uploaders who treat making vedieos as a job, it is very important to choose your direction and topics. If you cannot get the point of what types of vedios people prefer to watch and meet their needs, you will never be able to have a large number of fans or you will lose them quickly.</li>
                    <li>For job: Preparing materials for making vedios is required. There are two main ways to get inspiration. The first one is to keep obsevring in your daily life both online and in real life. If you don't have enough materials, Bilibili is always there to help you. The creation centre of Bilibili provides lots of hot materials at the moment.</li>
                    <li>For job: As the pictures show that there are many materials that have been prepared well for you, including hot topics, games, movies and good musics which you can use as background music.</li>
