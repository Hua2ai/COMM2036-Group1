            <div class = "box3">
                <h3>Why Review?</h3>
                <p>After uploading videos on Station B, the need for review is mainly to ensure the content quality and user experience of the Bilibili community. Bilibili is a video sharing community. Users can upload various types of videos on Bilibili, including original works, reposted videos, live broadcasts, etc. In order to ensure that the content on Station B complies with laws, regulations and community norms, and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of users, Station B reviews videos uploaded by users.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the review is to check whether the video content complies with the regulations and standards of Bilibili, including but not limited to whether there is any illegal content, whether it involves copyright and other issues. The review team will conduct a comprehensive review and screening of the uploaded videos to ensure the video quality and the legality of the content. If a video has content violations or other issues, the review team will either reject the video for publication, or ask the user to edit the video and submit it for review again.</p>
                <p>Videos that pass the review will be published on Bilibili for users to watch and share. In this way, the content quality and user experience of the Bilibili community can be guaranteed, and the reputation and user satisfaction of Bilibili can be improved. At the same time, the review can also help users understand the community norms and standards of Station B, improve users' awareness and quality of uploading videos, and create a good video sharing environment.</p>

                <h3>Review Process</h3>
                <p>Bilibili usually takes a few hours to a day to review a video, depending on the complexity of the video content and the length of the review queue. The review time may be longer if the video content you upload involves more complex topics or issues such as copyright.</p>
                <p>During the review process, Bilibili will review the content of your uploaded videos, including but not limited to whether there is any illegal content, whether it involves copyright and other issues. If the review passes, your video will be officially launched. If the review fails, Station B will send you the reason for the review failure and provide revision comments. You can make revisions based on the comments and submit it for review again.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that the review team of station B will try its best to ensure the fast and accurate review time, but due to the heavy review tasks and the complexity involved, the review time may be delayed. If your video has not been approved after more than 24 hours, it is recommended that you contact Bilibili customer service for help.</p>
